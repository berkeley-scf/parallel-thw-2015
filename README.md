# parallel-thw-2015
Materials for presentation on parallel processing at spring 2015 The Hacker Within meeting at UC Berkeley, presented by Chris Paciorek.

The tutorial material is in parallel.pdf, which is created from a Sweave-based lyx/Latex file (parallel.lyx / parallel.Rnw) using the knitr package in R:

Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit2pdf('parallel.Rnw')"
